What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- git creates a new repository under the name of the folder
- git does not add any commits to the repository, as the user may not want to commit all the files to the repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- Staging area is an intermediate area which will hold all the changes that needs to be committed to the repository.
- Only those files which are added to staging area can be committed to the repository.
