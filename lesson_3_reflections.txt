When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When I work with a team which has many members working and collaborating.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Developer knows when to update his/her source code from remote repository, manual pulling will be more appropriate.
- Automatic pulling can affect he changes made locally by the developer

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Fork -- GitHub will cone the respository to the developer's user account
- Clone -- Clone will make a copy of the remote repositoty to local machine, or will cone a local respository to another repository in the local machine
- branch - branch will copy the head revision of a branch to another branch within the same respository locally or remote

what is a fast forward branch?
- The main criteria for a fast forward merge is that, the branch you are merging into is an ancestor of the branch you are merging from.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- It is useful in a collaborative environment, when there are changes to remote repository while there are changes in the local, storing the
last known state of remote repository will help to merge the local changes with that of remote repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- would place all the files in a shared folder and control changes manually whenever some one wants to copy.
- Collaboration would be hard
- maintain different version will be hard
- rolling back a commit will be very difficult

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
- When we need to build a new feature
- When there are bug fixes identified for a certain release
- When there are many working on the project, then we can create one branch per person for their changes to go in.
